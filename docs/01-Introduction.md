# Introduction to Azure Machine Learning

## Overview

Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) is a cloud-based service for creating and managing machine learning solutions. It provides an end-to-end platform to build, train, deploy, and manage machine learning models at scale. This workshop is designed to help you understand the core concepts of machine learning and how to leverage Azure ML to implement these concepts in real-world scenarios.

## Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

- Understand the fundamentals of machine learning.
- Set up and configure the Azure Machine Learning environment.
- Prepare and explore data using Azure ML tools.
- Build, train, and evaluate machine learning models.
- Deploy models to production and monitor their performance.
- Utilize advanced features like Automated ML and Responsible AI.

## Target Audience

This workshop is intended for data scientists, machine learning engineers, and developers who want to learn how to use Azure Machine Learning to develop machine learning solutions. A basic understanding of machine learning concepts and Python programming is recommended but not required.
